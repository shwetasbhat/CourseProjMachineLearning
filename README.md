In this project, we will be using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set.
